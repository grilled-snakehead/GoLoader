**GoLoader**

**A Secure Shellcode Encryptor and Loader Written in Go**

GoLoader empowers you to encrypt shellcode for enhanced security and load it seamlessly within your applications. Built with Go, it offers a robust and efficient solution for handling sensitive shellcode.

**Features**

- **Encryption:** GoLoader employs a robust encryption algorithm to safeguard your shellcode, rendering it unreadable to unauthorized parties.
- **Loading:** The loader component facilitates the integration of encrypted shellcode into your applications, enabling its execution at runtime.
- **Go-Powered Efficiency:** GoLoader leverages the performance and versatility of Go, ensuring efficient encryption and loading processes.

**Installation**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install).
2. **Clone the Repository:** Use the following command to clone the GoLoader repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/grilled-snakehead/GoLoader.git
   ```

3. **Build GoLoader:** Navigate to the cloned directory and execute the build command:

   ```bash
   cd GoLoader
   go build
   ```

**Usage**

1. **Encryption:**
   - Prepare your shellcode in the desired format (e.g., a raw byte array).
   - Execute the `GoLoader` binary with the `-e` flag followed by the path to the output file for the encrypted shellcode:

   ```bash
   ./GoLoader -e encrypted_shellcode.bin shellcode.bin
   ```

   - Replace `shellcode.bin` with the path to your shellcode file and `encrypted_shellcode.bin` with the desired output filename.

2. **Loading (Integration with your application):**
   - Import the `GoLoader` package in your Go code.
   - Use the provided functions to load the encrypted shellcode from the file and decrypt it for execution.
   - Refer to the code examples within the `GoLoader` repository for detailed implementation guidance.

**Security Considerations**

- While encryption strengthens shellcode protection, it's crucial to remember that the security of your application heavily relies on other factors. Implement robust security measures within your application to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
- **Disclaimer:** GoLoader is intended for legitimate security research and testing purposes. Employing it for malicious activities is strictly prohibited.
